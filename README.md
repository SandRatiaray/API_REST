# This is my first REST API.

## run the API:

```bash
npm run devStart
```

## Testing API

A file named "route.rest" is created for testing the API directly in VSCode. You just have to install the plug-in [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) then in the page, you will see a button "send request" and will have the response in a new window.
But, you can use an other platform like POSTMAN/Insomnia.

next Upgrade : - add Token - add swagger
